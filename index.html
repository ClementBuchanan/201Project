    <img class="about-image" src="images/Clement.jpg">
    <p>I grew up in Brooklyn, NY in a diverse and multi-cultural community made up of immigrants
      originating from the Caribbean, Central and South America, Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East. I have had an
      extensive experience with cultures outside of my own, and still I seek opportunities to learn more from others
      with different perspectives on a variety of topics. My experience as a member of an underrepresented group has
      helped me strengthen my tolerance for others and cultivate a personal affinity for helping those who face similar
      challenges based on their identity. As a military veteran Iâ€™ve also had the distinct opportunity to serve with
      many individuals representing many cultures. I am equitable regarding their ethnicity, gender, age, religion,
      language, ability/disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or socioeconomic status. In my professional life
      as a public health professional I strive to be just and equitable with public health practices for those who are
      underrepresented.</p><br><br><br><br>
