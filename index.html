  <main>

    <p id="first-paragraph">I grew up in Brooklyn, NY in a diverse and multi-cultural community made up of immigrants originating from the Caribbean, Central and South America, Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East. I have had an extensive experience with cultures outside of my own, and still I seek opportunities to learn more from others with different perspectives on a variety of topics. My experience as a member of an underrepresented group has helped me strengthen my tolerance for others and cultivate a personal affinity for helping those who face similar challenges based on their identity. As a military veteran Iâ€™ve also had the distinct opportunity to serve with many individuals representing many cultures. I am equitable regarding their ethnicity, gender, age, religion, language, ability/disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or socioeconomic status. In my professional life as a public health professional I strive to be just and equitable with public health practices for those who are underrepresented.</p>
