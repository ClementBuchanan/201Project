# Lab - 02

## Project name: A game about me

I built an app with a sole purpose in mind. My app says a lot about me, my goals and aspirations as a software developer. This README page tells you about what the app does.

## Reflections and Comments

* WOW! ðŸ˜³ . Today was a tough one. The loops in lab 02 took me for a loop. Loops are my achilles and I admit they are aÂ  MUST KNOW part of being a software developer so I will bend the knee. I will learn them bit by bit. I could not have done todays lab if not for YouTube and other resources. Hooray for thatðŸ‘Œeven though I was saddened that I did not get it all completed.Â How will I address this issue? No later than tomorrow I will sign up for tutoring to tackle it.
